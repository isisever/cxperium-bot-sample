# Cxperium Bot Sample

### Creating a Chatbot with Cxperium Bot Engine

In this project, a chatbot is created using the Cxperium Bot Engine. Cxperium Bot Engine is a Node.js package that simplifies the creation and management of chatbots.

### Working Principle

1. Loading Environment Variables: When the project starts, the environment variables in the .env file are loaded. These variables include the port and host where the chatbot will run, the API key, and the callback URL.
2. Creating the Chatbot: After the environment variables are loaded, a chatbot is created using the Cxperium Bot Engine. This chatbot runs on the specified port and host, authenticates with the API key, and uses the callback URL.
3. Running the Chatbot: The created chatbot is run with the execute method. This method allows the chatbot to run on the specified port and host.
